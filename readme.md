> Cross-Platform interactive command shell for SharePoint Online

spo-shell is a cross-platform implementation of SharePoint shell commands written in straight ES6. No powershell cmdlets and confusing PnP installs.

While young, spo-shell aims to offer an alternative feel for navigating SharePoint online and to open the door to cross-platform bash-like scripting in a Javascript environment.

``` bash
> npm install @beyond-sharepoint/spo-shell -g
> spo-shell
spo / $
```

## FAQ

#### Why not SharePoint Online Powershell?

spo-shell allows one to interact with SharePoint online in an interactive manner rather than specifying all the URLs up front.

spo-shell is also cross-platform to free yourself from the shackles of monolithic development! 

#### But powershell is cross-platform now.

Sure, but there's not a SPO Powershell for .net core. Yet (?)
